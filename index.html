        <h1>Berry Hunt !</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>How to play:</h2>
            <p>To play Berry Hunt you must move around the garden <b>maze</b> using your <b>arrow keys</b>, and <b>collect</b> the <b>10</b> strawberries! Shhh! One is hidden. Can you find the last one? (under health bar)</p>
            <p>But Watch out! Dodge the <b>bumble bees</b> to keep your <b>health up</b>. One crawls towards you in anger, the other flies around minding its own business but if you touch it it will sting you! Also don't step into a <b>rose bush</b> or the thorns will scratch you!</p>
            <p>The plants(maze walls) will push out to the other side if you get stuck in a bramble(if you try to move straight through them) this can be both helpful and bad as it can be a shortcut but also might push you into a rose bush or bee.</p>
            <p>Don't worry, you can get your health back up by going into the <b>white blossom flowers</b>.</p>
